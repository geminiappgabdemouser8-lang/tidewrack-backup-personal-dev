# Tidewrack

A narrative adventure set on a fog-bound island off the Washington coast. You
are the new keeper of **Cape Marrow Light**. The keeper before you, Edith Vane,
rowed out into the fog eleven days ago and did not come back.

Built solo by **Fogline Games** (Seattle) in **Godot 4**, shipping to Steam.

> **Status:** Public-demo candidate (Steam Next Fest). Vertical slice +
> branching conversation with save/load. See [`docs/milestones.md`](docs/milestones.md)
> for the road to launch.

## Controls

| Action        | Key                     |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| Move          | Arrow keys              |
| Interact      | Enter / Space           |
| Advance / skip line | Enter / Space     |
| Pause / back  | Esc                     |

The game uses only Godot's built-in input actions, so it works with no input
remapping (controller support and remappable keys are a Public Demo milestone).

## Running it

Requires **Godot 4.3+** (standard, non-.NET build).

```bash
# Open in the editor
godot -e --path .

# Or run directly
godot --path .
```

The main scene is `scenes/main_menu.tscn`. Saves are written to Godot's
`user://save.json` (per-OS user data dir) — story flags, journal entries,
which objects have been examined, the player's position, and the conversation
in progress if the game was saved mid-dialogue, so Continue puts the player
back where they were. The file is written atomically (temp file + rename).

```

**Design note:** UI and levels are constructed in GDScript rather than authored
as large scene files. This keeps `.tscn` files small and reviewable in diffs and
avoids merge pain — a deliberate choice for a one-person studio.

## The dialogue system

Conversations are plain JSON graphs in `data/dialogue/`. Each node is either a
linear line (`"next": "<id>"`, or `null` to end) or a choice node (`"choices"`).
Any node can set story flags via `"set_flag"`, which `GameState` persists, or
record a journal entry via `"discover": "<entry id>"`.

```json
{
  "start": { "speaker": "Edith", "text": "…", "next": "choice1" },
  "choice1": {
    "text": "…",
    "choices": [
      { "text": "Trust her", "next": "end", "set_flag": { "trusted_edith": true } }
    ]
  },
  "end": { "speaker": "", "text": "…", "next": null }
}
```

## Verifying changes

```bash
# Validate every dialogue graph (targets resolve, has an ending, no orphans)
# and print the flag report (where each story flag is set / read; --no-flags to skip)
python3 tests/validate_dialogue.py

# Save/load round trip (needs Godot on PATH; uses user://save_test.json)
godot --headless --path . -s tests/test_save_load.gd

# In-engine checks (requires Godot on PATH)
godot --headless --path . --check-only   # parse all scripts
```

> The GDScript in this build was authored without a local Godot install, so it
> has been checked statically and via the dialogue validator, **not** yet run in
> the engine. First engine open may surface minor fixups — tracked in the issue
> list.

## Steam Next Fest demo

The public demo (target: **Steam Next Fest**) extends the vertical slice with
the lamp-room chapter, a discovered-logs journal, and controller support. Demo
scope is locked in [`docs/milestones.md`](docs/milestones.md); the build is
feature-frozen and tagged `v0.2-demo-rc`.

Demo controls add a gamepad (analog stick + A/B) on top of the keyboard bindings.
